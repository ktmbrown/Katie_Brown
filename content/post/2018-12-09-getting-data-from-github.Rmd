For every data project, you'll need to get your data from some source.  This short blog post will guide you through a few different ways of pulling data from a github repo.


### A. Download from link

#### Step 1: Install and load **downloader** package
You can download the data from a direct link by using the **downloader** package.  Install the package and use the **library()** function to load the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE, results=F}
install.packages("downloader")
library(downloader)
```
<br />

#### Step 2: Store link in variable
Navigate to the dataset you want to install and get a copy of the direct link by right clicking on the data file and clicking copy link.

Store this in a variable called *url*:

```{r}
url <- "https://github.com/curran/data/blob/gh-pages/motherjones/shootings-1982-2015.csv"
```
